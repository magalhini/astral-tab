# Nott Dagr

A simple project that shows you dawn, sunrise, sunset and dusk times for your location, as well as the moon phase. It allows you to fast-forward in time and check future dates for these events too.

## How to install

Clone the repository and install all dependencies by running:

`npm install`

You can run `npm start` once it's done to fire up Browsersync's local server.

## Documentation

To be added soon. I'm very sleepy now.
